        <p style="text-align:justify">Returning to the United States is an exhilarating adventure, especially during these unprecedented times. After a decade of living in Latin America to polish my  understanding of customs throughout the Americaâ€™s, I am back. While in Latin America I consulted multinational chief executives on international business. Our goal was to attract foreign investors by adapting international business standards. Global law firm partners also constituted a large part of my client base. I guided them through the complex legal English used in laws and contracts. Additionally, I  wrote proposals for software solutions. My extensive experience merging new technologies with established business practices allows me to adeptly outline programmable algorithms to automate tasks and increase productivity. I returned to the United States to care for my parents.
<br><br>Before relocating to Latin America, I acquired international business experience working with Cortado Inc., a German software company.  I became an expert at bridging the communication, cultural and legal gaps between countries. I coordinated multi-million dollar technical installations with our German developers, American technicians and Latin American clients all while adhering to local and international laws. I worked onsite with enterprises headquartered all throughout Latin America. My performance resulted in a yearly revenue increase of over 400%.
<br><br>Previous to my concentration on technology and international business, I was a Spanish-language media executive. I created new revenue channels by producing events and specialized publications. My intense drive to be socially responsible propelled my greatest productions. For example, at La Opinion I created a cross-platform campaign to expand healthcare throughout California, a precursor to The Affordable Care Act. I was able to coordinate all of the major broadcast companies to finance the campaign. Then at La Nueva Voz in Colorado I produced and moderated live televised debates, saturating the newspaper with revenue through display advertising.
<br><br>A career in Business Technology and Media was not something I could have imagined as a young student. Early in high school and in college I always thought my only career path was either as a doctor or scientist. So as a student I worked in labs trying to find a cure for diabetes then sequencing DNA. Science and math has always been effortlessly easy for me. It was not until my world opened up through exposure to urban cities that I dreamed of a career outside of a laboratory. With technology quickly absorbing every facet of operations, I am now perfectly positioned to merge my aptitudes with the future. 
<br><br>My creative talents give me the flexibility to bolster company strategies at any level. The exceptional quality of my work would enhance any organization. Please contact me to further assess how I can benefit you.
<br><br>Sincerely,
<br>J. Alfonso Maldonado</p>
